            <h2>
                About me
            </h2>

            <p>
                My name is Javi and at 37 years old I am still fascinated by technology and teamwork. Currently, working through Agile
                methodology with the latest technologies such as Angular, TypeScript, RxJs, Angular Material, Sass, HTML5, JSON ... in
                which I am comfortable on the Front development side. Not forgetting the old but great JavaScript, jQuery that I learned
                from the beginning.
            <br /><br />
                I have developed projects for different companies, in which I have been able to work side by side with great
                professionals, developing from small applications to large projects in which version control ("Thanks Git for arriving!
                ðŸ˜€") is essential, working from the technical designs to layout and full application development from scratch.
            <br /><br />
                I have also worked with Back technologies such as NodeJs, MongoDB, Java, SpringBoot, maven, REST since someone has to
                bring us the desired data to the Front. ðŸ˜‰
            </p>
