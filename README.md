### About Me

My name is Javi and at 40 years old I am still fascinated by technology and teamwork. Currently, working through Agile methodology with the latest technologies such as Angular, TypeScript, RxJs, Angular Material, Sass, HTML5, JSON ... in which I am comfortable on the Front development side. Not forgetting the old but great JavaScript, jQuery that I learned from the beginning.

I have developed projects for different companies, in which I have been able to work side by side with great professionals, developing from small applications to large projects in which version control ("Thanks Git for arriving! ðŸ˜€") is essential, working from the technical designs to layout and full application development from scratch.

I have also worked with Back technologies such as NodeJs, MongoDB, Java, SpringBoot, maven, REST since someone has to bring us the desired data to the Front. ðŸ˜‰
